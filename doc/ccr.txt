vim-c-cr
========

A very simple and small (twenty lines of vimscript) plugin that maps <c-cr> in insert mode and finishes braces ({}), brackets ([]) and parentheses (()) for you and puts you tabbed over on a blank line between them.

So,
{<c-cr>
or
[<c-cr>
or
(<c-cr>
will give you
{
  <your cursor here>
}
or
[
  <your cursor here>
]
or
(
  <your cursor here>
)
